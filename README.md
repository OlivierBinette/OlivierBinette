### Bonjour, I'm Olivier ğŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Statistical Science at Duke University. 

- ğŸŒ± I'm interested in statistical learning, Bayesian stats, R programming, privacy, sound science and democratizing statistics. 
- ğŸ”¬ My research has focused so far on Bayesian nonparametrics & theory, entity resolution and multiple systems estimation.
- ğŸ”­ I'm more and more looking to get involved in meaningful applications which relate to society, civil & human rights, and ethics.
- ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on privacy and the ethics of data science.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me anything! I like to talk about science and learn new things.
